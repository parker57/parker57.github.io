This was just a simple project to familiarise myself with web development.

Most elements are defined in the HTML document, though many are hidden. I tried to abstain from appending element to the DOM using JavaScript/JQuery - though in some instances this was neccessary (+x animations). Many Elements are loaded and simply immediatley hidden at the beggining of the script.

The JavaScript/Jquery is by no means good practice and I'm aware of this - it should however, read well and perform appropriatley.

I tried to make the UI as minimilist as possible while still keeping it intuitive, some users have told me it needs more information and I may implement tooltips for that.

With regards to the design of the site, the CSS and UI, I used bootstrap, it should be responsive and look reasonable on all standard displays from a small mobile to a large moniter.
